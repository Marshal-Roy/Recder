 Apriori Implementation
 
 It is an implementation of apriori algorithm of association rule learning in machine learning field.
 We train our model based on three parameters.
 1. Support
 2. Confidence
 3. Lift
 
 Support can be defined for an store item as the ratio of the number of transactions containing item I1 to total number of transaction occured.
                                 s= (transactions containing I1)/(total transactions)
 
 Similarly Confidence can be defined as 
                                    c=(transactions containing I1 and I2)/(transactions containing I1)
 And Lif
         l=(confidence(I1->I2))/(support(I2)
